					<p> ABSTRACT: <br>
						In the past few years permissivism has enjoyed somewhat of a revival, but it is once again being threatened, this time by a host of new and interesting arguments that, at their core, are challenging the permissivist to explain why rationality matters. A version of the challenge that I am especially interested in is this: if permissivism is true, why should we (in some sense) expect the rational credences to be more accurate than the irrational ones? (People who have advanced arguments along these lines recently include Sinan Dogramaci and Sophie Horowitz, Daniel Greco and Brian Hedden, Sophie Horowitz and Ben Levinstein).    It has also been argued (by David Christensen, Ben Levinstein and Matthew Kopec and Michael Titelbaum) that permissivism, even if true, doesn't have the implications for the debate about peer disagreement that it's frequently taken to have. In this paper I'll be arguing that, actually, it is those who deny permissivism that will have trouble explaining why rationality matters and why it conduces to accuracy.  I then use these considerations to explain why permissivism does indeed have important important implications for the debate about peer disagreement. </p>
